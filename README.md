# What is this?
This is a collection of some of the Greasemonkey scripts that I made, and (sometimes) maintain. 

# How do I use them?
Download Greasemonkey and copy the code into a script.

# What do the scripts do?
- BetterDates: Modifies the dates on speedrun.com, to make them absolute instead of relative to the current date.
- CustomYT: Allows you to hide watched videos with the press of a button (and other depricated features).
- RedditLagFix: Fixes new reddits habit of keeping every post you've seen in infinite scroll staying loaded on the client (Right now activation is manual).

# One or more of these scripts doesn't work anymore!
Let me know so I can take note of it, if you fix it, let me know, if not, use something else.
